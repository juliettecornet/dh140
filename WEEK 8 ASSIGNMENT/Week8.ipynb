What\\'s the news with thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS\\r\\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\\r\\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.--\\r\\nStand forth, Demetrius.--My noble lord,\\r\\nThis man hath my consent to marry her.--\\r\\nStand forth, Lysander.--And, my gracious duke,\\r\\nThis man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.--\\r\\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes\\r\\nAnd interchanged love tokens with my child.\\r\\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung\\r\\nWith feigning voice verses of feigning love\\r\\nAnd stol\\'n the impression of her fantasy\\r\\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,\\r\\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats--messengers\\r\\nOf strong prevailment in unhardened youth.\\r\\nWith cunning hast thou filched my daughter\\'s heart,\\r\\nTurned her obedience (which is due to me)\\r\\nTo stubborn harshness.--And, my gracious duke,\\r\\nBe it so she will not here before your Grace\\r\\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\\r\\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens:\\r\\nAs she is mine, I may dispose of her,\\r\\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\\r\\nOr to her death, according to our law\\r\\nImmediately provided in that case.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nWhat say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.\\r\\nTo you, your father should be as a god,\\r\\nOne that composed your beauties, yea, and one\\r\\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\\r\\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\\r\\nTo leave the figure or disfigure it.\\r\\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nSo is Lysander.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  In himself he is,\\r\\nBut in this kind, wanting your father\\'s voice,\\r\\nThe other must be held the worthier.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI would my father looked but with my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\\r\\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\\r\\nNor how it may concern my modesty\\r\\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts;\\r\\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\\r\\nThe worst that may befall me in this case\\r\\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nEither to die the death or to abjure\\r\\nForever the society of men.\\r\\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\\r\\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\\r\\nWhether (if you yield not to your father\\'s choice)\\r\\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\\r\\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mewed,\\r\\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\\r\\nChanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.\\r\\nThrice-blessed they that master so their blood\\r\\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage,\\r\\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distilled\\r\\nThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\\r\\nGrows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nSo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\\r\\nEre I will yield my virgin patent up\\r\\nUnto his Lordship whose unwished yoke\\r\\nMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nTake time to pause, and by the next new moon\\r\\n(The sealing day betwixt my love and me\\r\\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship),\\r\\nUpon that day either prepare to die\\r\\nFor disobedience to your father\\'s will,\\r\\nOr else to wed Demetrius, as he would,\\r\\nOr on Diana\\'s altar to protest\\r\\nFor aye austerity and single life.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nRelent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield\\r\\nThy crazed title to my certain right.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nYou have her father\\'s love, Demetrius.\\r\\nLet me have Hermia\\'s. Do you marry him.\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS\\r\\nScornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;\\r\\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him.\\r\\nAnd she is mine, and all my right of her\\r\\nI do estate unto Demetrius.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER, [to Theseus]\\r\\nI am, my lord, as well derived as he,\\r\\nAs well possessed. My love is more than his;\\r\\nMy fortunes every way as fairly ranked\\r\\n(If not with vantage) as Demetrius\\';\\r\\nAnd (which is more than all these boasts can be)\\r\\nI am beloved of beauteous Hermia.\\r\\nWhy should not I then prosecute my right?\\r\\nDemetrius, I\\'ll avouch it to his head,\\r\\nMade love to Nedar\\'s daughter, Helena,\\r\\nAnd won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\\r\\nDevoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,\\r\\nUpon this spotted and inconstant man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\\r\\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\\r\\nBut, being overfull of self-affairs,\\r\\nMy mind did lose it.--But, Demetrius, come,\\r\\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me.\\r\\nI have some private schooling for you both.--\\r\\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\\r\\nTo fit your fancies to your father\\'s will,\\r\\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up\\r\\n(Which by no means we may extenuate)\\r\\nTo death or to a vow of single life.--\\r\\nCome, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?--\\r\\nDemetrius and Egeus, go along.\\r\\nI must employ you in some business\\r\\nAgainst our nuptial and confer with you\\r\\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS\\r\\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\\r\\n[All but Hermia and Lysander exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nHow now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?\\r\\nHow chance the roses there do fade so fast?\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nBelike for want of rain, which I could well\\r\\nBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nAy me! For aught that I could ever read,\\r\\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\\r\\nThe course of true love never did run smooth.\\r\\nBut either it was different in blood--\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nO cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nOr else misgraffed in respect of years--\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nO spite! Too old to be engaged to young.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nOr else it stood upon the choice of friends--\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nO hell, to choose love by another\\'s eyes!\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nOr, if there were a sympathy in choice,\\r\\nWar, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,\\r\\nMaking it momentany as a sound,\\r\\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream,\\r\\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night,\\r\\nThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth,\\r\\nAnd, ere a man hath power to say \"Behold!\"\\r\\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up.\\r\\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nIf then true lovers have been ever crossed,\\r\\nIt stands as an edict in destiny.\\r\\nThen let us teach our trial patience\\r\\nBecause it is a customary cross,\\r\\nAs due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,\\r\\nWishes and tears, poor fancy\\'s followers.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nA good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:\\r\\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\\r\\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child.\\r\\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues,\\r\\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\\r\\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;\\r\\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\\r\\nCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then\\r\\nSteal forth thy father\\'s house tomorrow night,\\r\\nAnd in the wood a league without the town\\r\\n(Where I did meet thee once with Helena\\r\\nTo do observance to a morn of May),\\r\\nThere will I stay for thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA  My good Lysander,\\r\\nI swear to thee by Cupid\\'s strongest bow,\\r\\nBy his best arrow with the golden head,\\r\\nBy the simplicity of Venus\\' doves,\\r\\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\\r\\nAnd by that fire which burned the Carthage queen\\r\\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,\\r\\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke\\r\\n(In number more than ever women spoke),\\r\\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me,\\r\\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Helena.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nGodspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nCall you me \"fair\"?

O happy fair!\\r\\nYour eyes are lodestars and your tongue\\'s sweet air\\r\\nMore tunable than lark to shepherd\\'s ear\\r\\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\\r\\nSickness is catching. O, were favor so!\\r\\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.\\r\\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;\\r\\nMy tongue should catch your tongue\\'s sweet\\r\\nmelody.\\r\\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\\r\\nThe rest I\\'d give to be to you translated.\\r\\nO, teach me how you look and with what art\\r\\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius\\' heart!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nO, that your frowns would teach my smiles such\\r\\nskill!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nO, that my prayers could such affection move!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nNone but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nTake comfort: he no more shall see my face.\\r\\nLysander and myself will fly this place.\\r\\nBefore the time I did Lysander see\\r\\nSeemed Athens as a paradise to me.\\r\\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell\\r\\nThat he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold.\\r\\nTomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold\\r\\nHer silver visage in the wat\\'ry glass,\\r\\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass\\r\\n(A time that lovers\\' flights doth still conceal),\\r\\nThrough Athens\\' gates have we devised to steal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\\r\\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\\r\\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\\r\\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet\\r\\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes\\r\\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\\r\\nFarewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\\r\\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.--\\r\\nKeep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\\r\\nFrom lovers\\' food till morrow deep midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nI will, my Hermia.\\t[Hermia exits.]\\r\\nHelena, adieu.\\r\\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\\r\\n[Lysander exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nHow happy some o\\'er other some can be!\\r\\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\\r\\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.\\r\\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\\r\\nAnd, as he errs, doting on Hermia\\'s eyes,\\r\\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\\r\\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\\r\\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\\r\\nLove looks not with the eyes but with the mind;\\r\\nAnd therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\\r\\nNor hath Love\\'s mind of any judgment taste.\\r\\nWings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.\\r\\nAnd therefore is Love said to be a child\\r\\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguiled.\\r\\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\\r\\nSo the boy Love is perjured everywhere.\\r\\nFor, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia\\'s eyne,\\r\\nHe hailed down oaths that he was only mine;\\r\\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\\r\\nSo he dissolved, and show\\'rs of oaths did melt.\\r\\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia\\'s flight.\\r\\nThen to the wood will he tomorrow night\\r\\nPursue her. And, for this intelligence\\r\\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.\\r\\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\\r\\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\\r\\n[She exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nScene 2\\r\\n=======\\r\\n[Enter Quince the carpenter, and Snug the joiner, and\\r\\nBottom the weaver, and Flute the bellows-mender, and\\r\\nSnout the tinker, and Starveling the tailor.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Is all our company here?\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  You were best to call them generally, man by\\r\\nman, according to the scrip.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Here is the scroll of every man\\'s name which\\r\\nis thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our\\r\\ninterlude before the Duke and the Duchess on his\\r\\nwedding day at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  First, good Peter Quince, say what the play\\r\\ntreats on, then read the names of the actors, and so\\r\\ngrow to a point.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Marry, our play is \"The most lamentable\\r\\ncomedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and\\r\\nThisbe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a\\r\\nmerry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your\\r\\nactors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Ready. Name what part I am for, and\\r\\nproceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  What is Pyramus--a lover or a tyrant?\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  That will ask some tears in the true performing\\r\\nof it. If I do it, let the audience look to their\\r\\neyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some\\r\\nmeasure. To the rest.--Yet my chief humor is for a\\r\\ntyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a\\r\\ncat in, to make all split:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe raging rocks\\r\\n\\tAnd shivering shocks\\r\\n\\tShall break the locks\\r\\n\\t   Of prison gates.\\r\\n\\tAnd Phibbus\\' car\\r\\n\\tShall shine from far\\r\\n\\tAnd make and mar\\r\\n\\t   The foolish Fates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was lofty. Now name the rest of the players.\\r\\nThis is Ercles\\' vein, a tyrant\\'s vein. A lover is more\\r\\ncondoling.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLUTE  Here, Peter Quince.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLUTE  What is Thisbe--a wand\\'ring knight?\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  It is the lady that Pyramus must love.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLUTE  Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a\\r\\nbeard coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  That\\'s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and\\r\\nyou may speak as small as you will.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.\\r\\nI\\'ll speak in a monstrous little voice: \"Thisne,\\r\\nThisne!\"--\"Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbe\\r\\ndear and lady dear!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  No, no, you must play Pyramus--and, Flute,\\r\\nyou Thisbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Well, proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Robin Starveling, the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING  Here, Peter Quince.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe\\'s\\r\\nmother.--Tom Snout, the tinker.\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOUT  Here, Peter Quince.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  You, Pyramus\\' father.--Myself, Thisbe\\'s\\r\\nfather.--Snug the joiner, you the lion\\'s part.--\\r\\nAnd I hope here is a play fitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSNUG  Have you the lion\\'s part written? Pray you, if it\\r\\nbe, give it me, for I am slow of study.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but\\r\\nroaring.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will\\r\\ndo any man\\'s heart good to hear me. I will roar that\\r\\nI will make the Duke say \"Let him roar again. Let\\r\\nhim roar again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  An you should do it too terribly, you would\\r\\nfright the Duchess and the ladies that they would\\r\\nshriek, and that were enough to hang us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nALL  That would hang us, every mother\\'s son.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  I grant you, friends, if you should fright the\\r\\nladies out of their wits, they would have no more\\r\\ndiscretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my\\r\\nvoice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking\\r\\ndove. I will roar you an \\'twere any nightingale.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus\\r\\nis a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one\\r\\nshall see in a summer\\'s day, a most lovely gentlemanlike\\r\\nman. Therefore you must needs play \\r\\nPyramus.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I\\r\\nbest to play it in?\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Why, what you will.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  I will discharge it in either your straw-color\\r\\nbeard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain\\r\\nbeard, or your French-crown-color beard,\\r\\nyour perfit yellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Some of your French crowns have no hair at\\r\\nall, and then you will play barefaced. But, masters,\\r\\nhere are your parts, [giving out the parts,] and I am\\r\\nto entreat you, request you, and desire you to con\\r\\nthem by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace\\r\\nwood, a mile without the town, by moonlight. There\\r\\nwill we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall\\r\\nbe dogged with company and our devices known. In\\r\\nthe meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as\\r\\nour play wants. I pray you fail me not.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  We will meet, and there we may rehearse\\r\\nmost obscenely and courageously. Take pains. Be\\r\\nperfit. Adieu.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  At the Duke\\'s Oak we meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Enough. Hold or cut bowstrings.\\r\\n[They exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT 2\\r\\n=====\\r\\n\\r\\nScene 1\\r\\n=======\\r\\n[Enter a Fairy at one door and Robin Goodfellow at\\r\\nanother.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nROBIN\\r\\nHow now, spirit?

Fairies, skip hence.\\r\\nI have forsworn his bed and company.\\r\\n\\r\\nOBERON\\r\\nTarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nTITANIA\\r\\nThen I must be thy lady. But I know\\r\\nWhen thou hast stolen away from Fairyland\\r\\nAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day\\r\\nPlaying on pipes of corn and versing love\\r\\nTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\\r\\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\\r\\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\\r\\nYour buskined mistress and your warrior love,\\r\\nTo Theseus must be wedded, and you come\\r\\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity?\\r\\n\\r\\nOBERON\\r\\nHow canst thou thus for shame, Titania,\\r\\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\\r\\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\\r\\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering\\r\\nnight\\r\\nFrom Perigouna, whom he ravished,\\r\\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\\r\\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\\r\\n\\r\\nTITANIA\\r\\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy;\\r\\nAnd never, since the middle summer\\'s spring,\\r\\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\\r\\nBy paved fountain or by rushy brook,\\r\\nOr in the beached margent of the sea,\\r\\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\\r\\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.\\r\\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\\r\\nAs in revenge have sucked up from the sea\\r\\nContagious fogs, which, falling in the land,\\r\\nHath every pelting river made so proud\\r\\nThat they have overborne their continents.\\r\\nThe ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,\\r\\nThe plowman lost his sweat, and the green corn\\r\\nHath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.\\r\\nThe fold stands empty in the drowned field,\\r\\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrain flock.\\r\\nThe nine-men\\'s-morris is filled up with mud,\\r\\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\\r\\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable.\\r\\nThe human mortals want their winter here.\\r\\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blessed.\\r\\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\\r\\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\\r\\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound.\\r\\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\\r\\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\\r\\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,\\r\\nAnd on old Hiems\\' thin and icy crown\\r\\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\\r\\nIs, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,\\r\\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\\r\\nTheir wonted liveries, and the mazed world\\r\\nBy their increase now knows not which is which.\\r\\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\\r\\nFrom our debate, from our dissension;\\r\\nWe are their parents and original.\\r\\n\\r\\nOBERON\\r\\nDo you amend it, then. It lies in you.\\r\\nWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\\r\\nI do but beg a little changeling boy\\r\\nTo be my henchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nTITANIA  Set your heart at rest:\\r\\nThe Fairyland buys not the child of me.\\r\\nHis mother was a vot\\'ress of my order,\\r\\nAnd in the spiced Indian air by night\\r\\nFull often hath she gossiped by my side\\r\\nAnd sat with me on Neptune\\'s yellow sands,\\r\\nMarking th\\' embarked traders on the flood,\\r\\nWhen we have laughed to see the sails conceive\\r\\nAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\\r\\nWhich she, with pretty and with swimming gait,\\r\\nFollowing (her womb then rich with my young\\r\\nsquire),\\r\\nWould imitate and sail upon the land\\r\\nTo fetch me trifles and return again,\\r\\nAs from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\\r\\nBut she, being mortal, of that boy did die,\\r\\nAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy,\\r\\nAnd for her sake I will not part with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOBERON\\r\\nHow long within this wood intend you stay?\\r\\n\\r\\nTITANIA\\r\\nPerchance till after Theseus\\' wedding day.\\r\\nIf you will patiently dance in our round\\r\\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us.\\r\\nIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOBERON\\r\\nGive me that boy and I will go with thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nTITANIA\\r\\nNot for thy fairy kingdom.

Thou shalt not from this grove\\r\\nTill I torment thee for this injury.--\\r\\nMy gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb\\'rest\\r\\nSince once I sat upon a promontory\\r\\nAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin\\'s back\\r\\nUttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\\r\\nThat the rude sea grew civil at her song\\r\\nAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheres\\r\\nTo hear the sea-maid\\'s music.\\r\\n\\r\\nROBIN  I remember.\\r\\n\\r\\nOBERON\\r\\nThat very time I saw (but thou couldst not),\\r\\nFlying between the cold moon and the Earth,\\r\\nCupid all armed. A certain aim he took\\r\\nAt a fair vestal throned by the west,\\r\\nAnd loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow\\r\\nAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.\\r\\nBut I might see young Cupid\\'s fiery shaft\\r\\nQuenched in the chaste beams of the wat\\'ry moon,\\r\\nAnd the imperial vot\\'ress passed on\\r\\nIn maiden meditation, fancy-free.\\r\\nYet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.\\r\\nIt fell upon a little western flower,\\r\\nBefore, milk-white, now purple with love\\'s wound,\\r\\nAnd maidens call it \"love-in-idleness.\"\\r\\nFetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once.\\r\\nThe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\\r\\nWill make or man or woman madly dote\\r\\nUpon the next live creature that it sees.\\r\\nFetch me this herb, and be thou here again\\r\\nEre the leviathan can swim a league.\\r\\n\\r\\nROBIN\\r\\nI\\'ll put a girdle round about the Earth\\r\\nIn forty minutes.\\t[He exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOBERON  Having once this juice,\\r\\nI\\'ll watch Titania when she is asleep\\r\\nAnd drop the liquor of it in her eyes.\\r\\nThe next thing then she, waking, looks upon\\r\\n(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,\\r\\nOn meddling monkey, or on busy ape)\\r\\nShe shall pursue it with the soul of love.\\r\\nAnd ere I take this charm from off her sight\\r\\n(As I can take it with another herb),\\r\\nI\\'ll make her render up her page to me.\\r\\nBut who comes here? I am invisible,\\r\\nAnd I will overhear their conference.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nI love thee not; therefore pursue me not.\\r\\nWhere is Lysander and fair Hermia?\\r\\nThe one I\\'ll stay; the other stayeth me.\\r\\nThou told\\'st me they were stol\\'n unto this wood,\\r\\nAnd here am I, and wood within this wood\\r\\nBecause I cannot meet my Hermia.\\r\\nHence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nYou draw me, you hard-hearted adamant!\\r\\nBut yet you draw not iron, for my heart\\r\\nIs true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,\\r\\nAnd I shall have no power to follow you.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nDo I entice you? Do I speak you fair?\\r\\nOr rather do I not in plainest truth\\r\\nTell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAnd even for that do I love you the more.\\r\\nI am your spaniel, and, Demetrius,\\r\\nThe more you beat me I will fawn on you.\\r\\nUse me but as your spaniel: spurn me, strike me,\\r\\nNeglect me, lose me; only give me leave\\r\\n(Unworthy as I am) to follow you.\\r\\nWhat worser place can I beg in your love\\r\\n(And yet a place of high respect with me)\\r\\nThan to be used as you use your dog?\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nTempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,\\r\\nFor I am sick when I do look on thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAnd I am sick when I look not on you.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nYou do impeach your modesty too much\\r\\nTo leave the city and commit yourself\\r\\nInto the hands of one that loves you not,\\r\\nTo trust the opportunity of night\\r\\nAnd the ill counsel of a desert place\\r\\nWith the rich worth of your virginity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nYour virtue is my privilege. For that\\r\\nIt is not night when I do see your face,\\r\\nTherefore I think I am not in the night.\\r\\nNor doth this wood lack worlds of company,\\r\\nFor you, in my respect, are all the world.\\r\\nThen, how can it be said I am alone\\r\\nWhen all the world is here to look on me?\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nI\\'ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes\\r\\nAnd leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nThe wildest hath not such a heart as you.\\r\\nRun when you will. The story shall be changed:\\r\\nApollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;\\r\\nThe dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind\\r\\nMakes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speed\\r\\nWhen cowardice pursues and valor flies!\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nI will not stay thy questions. Let me go,\\r\\nOr if thou follow me, do not believe\\r\\nBut I shall do thee mischief in the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAy, in the temple, in the town, the field,\\r\\nYou do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!\\r\\nYour wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.\\r\\nWe cannot fight for love as men may do.\\r\\nWe should be wooed and were not made to woo.\\r\\n[Demetrius exits.]\\r\\nI\\'ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell\\r\\nTo die upon the hand I love so well.\\t[Helena exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOBERON\\r\\nFare thee well, nymph.

And here\\'s a marvels convenient\\r\\nplace for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be\\r\\nour stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house,\\r\\nand we will do it in action as we will do it before\\r\\nthe Duke.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Peter Quince?\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  What sayest thou, bully Bottom?\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  There are things in this comedy of Pyramus\\r\\nand Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus\\r\\nmust draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies\\r\\ncannot abide. How answer you that?\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOUT  By \\'r lakin, a parlous fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING  I believe we must leave the killing out,\\r\\nwhen all is done.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Not a whit! I have a device to make all well.\\r\\nWrite me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to\\r\\nsay we will do no harm with our swords and that\\r\\nPyramus is not killed indeed. And, for the more\\r\\nbetter assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not\\r\\nPyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them\\r\\nout of fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall\\r\\nbe written in eight and six.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  No, make it two more. Let it be written in\\r\\neight and eight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOUT  Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\\r\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING  I fear it, I promise you.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Masters, you ought to consider with yourself,\\r\\nto bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies is a\\r\\nmost dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful\\r\\nwildfowl than your lion living, and we ought to look\\r\\nto \\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOUT  Therefore another prologue must tell he is not\\r\\na lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Nay, you must name his name, and half his\\r\\nface must be seen through the lion\\'s neck, and he\\r\\nhimself must speak through, saying thus, or to the\\r\\nsame defect: \"Ladies,\" or \"Fair ladies, I would\\r\\nwish you,\" or \"I would request you,\" or \"I would\\r\\nentreat you not to fear, not to tremble! My life for\\r\\nyours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were\\r\\npity of my life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man as\\r\\nother men are.\" And there indeed let him name his\\r\\nname and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard\\r\\nthings: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber,\\r\\nfor you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by\\r\\nmoonlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOUT  Doth the moon shine that night we play our\\r\\nplay?\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac.\\r\\nFind out moonshine, find out moonshine.\\r\\n[Quince takes out a book.]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Yes, it doth shine that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Why, then, may you leave a casement of the\\r\\ngreat chamber window, where we play, open, and\\r\\nthe moon may shine in at the casement.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Ay, or else one must come in with a bush of\\r\\nthorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure\\r\\nor to present the person of Moonshine. Then there\\r\\nis another thing: we must have a wall in the great\\r\\nchamber, for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story,\\r\\ndid talk through the chink of a wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOUT  You can never bring in a wall. What say you,\\r\\nBottom?\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Some man or other must present Wall. And\\r\\nlet him have some plaster, or some loam, or some\\r\\nroughcast about him to signify wall, or let him\\r\\nhold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall\\r\\nPyramus and Thisbe whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,\\r\\nevery mother\\'s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus,\\r\\nyou begin. When you have spoken your\\r\\nspeech, enter into that brake, and so everyone\\r\\naccording to his cue.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Robin invisible to those onstage.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nROBIN, [aside]\\r\\nWhat hempen homespuns have we swagg\\'ring here\\r\\nSo near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?\\r\\nWhat, a play toward? I\\'ll be an auditor--\\r\\nAn actor too perhaps, if I see cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Speak, Pyramus.--Thisbe, stand forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM, [as Pyramus]\\r\\n\\tThisbe, the flowers of odious savors sweet--\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Odors, odors!\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM, [as Pyramus]\\r\\n\\t\\t...odors savors sweet.\\r\\n\\tSo hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.--\\r\\n\\tBut hark, a voice!

Why, you must not\\r\\nspeak that yet. That you answer to Pyramus. You\\r\\nspeak all your part at once, cues and all.--Pyramus,\\r\\nenter. Your cue is past. It is \"never tire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFLUTE  O!\\r\\n[As Thisbe.] As true as truest horse, that yet would never\\r\\ntire.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Robin, and Bottom as Pyramus with the\\r\\nass-head.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM, [as Pyramus]\\r\\n\\tIf I were fair, fair Thisbe, I were only thine.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray,\\r\\nmasters, fly, masters! Help!\\r\\n[Quince, Flute, Snout, Snug, and Starveling exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\nROBIN\\r\\nI\\'ll follow you. I\\'ll lead you about a round,\\r\\n   Through bog, through bush, through brake,\\r\\n   through brier.\\r\\nSometime a horse I\\'ll be, sometime a hound,\\r\\n   A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire,\\r\\nAnd neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn,\\r\\nLike horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.\\r\\n[He exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Why do they run away? This is a knavery of\\r\\nthem to make me afeard.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Snout.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOUT  O Bottom, thou art changed! What do I see on\\r\\nthee?\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  What do you see? You see an ass-head of your\\r\\nown, do you?\\t[Snout exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Quince.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee! Thou art\\r\\ntranslated!\\t[He exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  I see their knavery. This is to make an ass of\\r\\nme, to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir\\r\\nfrom this place, do what they can. I will walk up\\r\\nand down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear\\r\\nI am not afraid.\\r\\n[He sings.]\\tThe ouzel cock, so black of hue,\\r\\n\\t   With orange-tawny bill,\\r\\n\\tThe throstle with his note so true,\\r\\n\\t   The wren with little quill--\\r\\n\\r\\nTITANIA, [waking up]\\r\\nWhat angel wakes me from my flow\\'ry bed?\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM [sings]\\r\\n\\tThe finch, the sparrow, and the lark,\\r\\n\\t   The plainsong cuckoo gray,\\r\\n\\tWhose note full many a man doth mark\\r\\n\\t   And dares not answer \"nay\"--\\r\\nfor, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a\\r\\nbird? Who would give a bird the lie though he cry\\r\\n\"cuckoo\" never so?\\r\\n\\r\\nTITANIA\\r\\nI pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.\\r\\nMine ear is much enamored of thy note,\\r\\nSo is mine eye enthralled to thy shape,\\r\\nAnd thy fair virtue\\'s force perforce doth move me\\r\\nOn the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Methinks, mistress, you should have little\\r\\nreason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason\\r\\nand love keep little company together nowadays.\\r\\nThe more the pity that some honest neighbors will\\r\\nnot make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon\\r\\noccasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTITANIA\\r\\nThou art as wise as thou art beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Not so neither; but if I had wit enough to get\\r\\nout of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own\\r\\nturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nTITANIA\\r\\nOut of this wood do not desire to go.\\r\\nThou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.\\r\\nI am a spirit of no common rate.\\r\\nThe summer still doth tend upon my state,\\r\\nAnd I do love thee.

I see you all are bent\\r\\nTo set against me for your merriment.\\r\\nIf you were civil and knew courtesy,\\r\\nYou would not do me thus much injury.\\r\\nCan you not hate me, as I know you do,\\r\\nBut you must join in souls to mock me too?\\r\\nIf you were men, as men you are in show,\\r\\nYou would not use a gentle lady so,\\r\\nTo vow and swear and superpraise my parts,\\r\\nWhen, I am sure, you hate me with your hearts.\\r\\nYou both are rivals and love Hermia,\\r\\nAnd now both rivals to mock Helena.\\r\\nA trim exploit, a manly enterprise,\\r\\nTo conjure tears up in a poor maid\\'s eyes\\r\\nWith your derision! None of noble sort\\r\\nWould so offend a virgin and extort\\r\\nA poor soul\\'s patience, all to make you sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nYou are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so,\\r\\nFor you love Hermia; this you know I know.\\r\\nAnd here with all goodwill, with all my heart,\\r\\nIn Hermia\\'s love I yield you up my part.\\r\\nAnd yours of Helena to me bequeath,\\r\\nWhom I do love and will do till my death.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nNever did mockers waste more idle breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nLysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none.\\r\\nIf e\\'er I loved her, all that love is gone.\\r\\nMy heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned,\\r\\nAnd now to Helen is it home returned,\\r\\nThere to remain.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER  Helen, it is not so.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nDisparage not the faith thou dost not know,\\r\\nLest to thy peril thou aby it dear.\\r\\nLook where thy love comes. Yonder is thy dear.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Hermia.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA, [to Lysander]\\r\\nDark night, that from the eye his function takes,\\r\\nThe ear more quick of apprehension makes;\\r\\nWherein it doth impair the seeing sense,\\r\\nIt pays the hearing double recompense.\\r\\nThou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;\\r\\nMine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.\\r\\nBut why unkindly didst thou leave me so?\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nWhy should he stay whom love doth press to go?\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nWhat love could press Lysander from my side?\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nLysander\\'s love, that would not let him bide,\\r\\nFair Helena, who more engilds the night\\r\\nThan all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.\\r\\nWhy seek\\'st thou me? Could not this make thee\\r\\nknow\\r\\nThe hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nYou speak not as you think. It cannot be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nLo, she is one of this confederacy!\\r\\nNow I perceive they have conjoined all three\\r\\nTo fashion this false sport in spite of me.--\\r\\nInjurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,\\r\\nHave you conspired, have you with these contrived,\\r\\nTo bait me with this foul derision?\\r\\nIs all the counsel that we two have shared,\\r\\nThe sisters\\' vows, the hours that we have spent\\r\\nWhen we have chid the hasty-footed time\\r\\nFor parting us--O, is all forgot?\\r\\nAll schooldays\\' friendship, childhood innocence?\\r\\nWe, Hermia, like two artificial gods,\\r\\nHave with our needles created both one flower,\\r\\nBoth on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,\\r\\nBoth warbling of one song, both in one key,\\r\\nAs if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds\\r\\nHad been incorporate. So we grew together\\r\\nLike to a double cherry, seeming parted,\\r\\nBut yet an union in partition,\\r\\nTwo lovely berries molded on one stem;\\r\\nSo with two seeming bodies but one heart,\\r\\nTwo of the first, like coats in heraldry,\\r\\nDue but to one, and crowned with one crest.\\r\\nAnd will you rent our ancient love asunder,\\r\\nTo join with men in scorning your poor friend?\\r\\nIt is not friendly; \\'tis not maidenly.\\r\\nOur sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,\\r\\nThough I alone do feel the injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI am amazed at your words.\\r\\nI scorn you not. It seems that you scorn me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nHave you not set Lysander, as in scorn,\\r\\nTo follow me and praise my eyes and face,\\r\\nAnd made your other love, Demetrius,\\r\\nWho even but now did spurn me with his foot,\\r\\nTo call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,\\r\\nPrecious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this\\r\\nTo her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander\\r\\nDeny your love (so rich within his soul)\\r\\nAnd tender me, forsooth, affection,\\r\\nBut by your setting on, by your consent?\\r\\nWhat though I be not so in grace as you,\\r\\nSo hung upon with love, so fortunate,\\r\\nBut miserable most, to love unloved?\\r\\nThis you should pity rather than despise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI understand not what you mean by this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAy, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks,\\r\\nMake mouths upon me when I turn my back,\\r\\nWink each at other, hold the sweet jest up.\\r\\nThis sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.\\r\\nIf you have any pity, grace, or manners,\\r\\nYou would not make me such an argument.\\r\\nBut fare you well. \\'Tis partly my own fault,\\r\\nWhich death or absence soon shall remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nStay, gentle Helena.

Vile thing, let loose,\\r\\nOr I will shake thee from me like a serpent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nWhy are you grown so rude? What change is this,\\r\\nSweet love?\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER  Thy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out!\\r\\nOut, loathed med\\'cine! O, hated potion, hence!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nDo you not jest?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA  Yes, sooth, and so do you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nDemetrius, I will keep my word with thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nI would I had your bond. For I perceive\\r\\nA weak bond holds you. I\\'ll not trust your word.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nWhat? Should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?\\r\\nAlthough I hate her, I\\'ll not harm her so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nWhat, can you do me greater harm than hate?\\r\\nHate me? Wherefore? O me, what news, my love?\\r\\nAm not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?\\r\\nI am as fair now as I was erewhile.\\r\\nSince night you loved me; yet since night you left\\r\\nme.\\r\\nWhy, then, you left me--O, the gods forbid!--\\r\\nIn earnest, shall I say?\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER  Ay, by my life,\\r\\nAnd never did desire to see thee more.\\r\\nTherefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.\\r\\nBe certain, nothing truer, \\'tis no jest\\r\\nThat I do hate thee and love Helena.\\r\\n[Hermia turns him loose.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nO me!

What, will you tear\\r\\nImpatient answers from my gentle tongue?\\r\\nFie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\n\"Puppet\"? Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.\\r\\nNow I perceive that she hath made compare\\r\\nBetween our statures; she hath urged her height,\\r\\nAnd with her personage, her tall personage,\\r\\nHer height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.\\r\\nAnd are you grown so high in his esteem\\r\\nBecause I am so dwarfish and so low?\\r\\nHow low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak!\\r\\nHow low am I? I am not yet so low\\r\\nBut that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nI pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,\\r\\nLet her not hurt me. I was never curst;\\r\\nI have no gift at all in shrewishness.\\r\\nI am a right maid for my cowardice.\\r\\nLet her not strike me.

Hark, again!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nGood Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.\\r\\nI evermore did love you, Hermia,\\r\\nDid ever keep your counsels, never wronged you--\\r\\nSave that, in love unto Demetrius,\\r\\nI told him of your stealth unto this wood.\\r\\nHe followed you; for love, I followed him.\\r\\nBut he hath chid me hence and threatened me\\r\\nTo strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too.\\r\\nAnd now, so you will let me quiet go,\\r\\nTo Athens will I bear my folly back\\r\\nAnd follow you no further.

A cry more tunable\\r\\nWas never holloed to, nor cheered with horn,\\r\\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.\\r\\nJudge when you hear.--But soft! What nymphs are\\r\\nthese?\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS\\r\\nMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep,\\r\\nAnd this Lysander; this Demetrius is,\\r\\nThis Helena, old Nedar\\'s Helena.\\r\\nI wonder of their being here together.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nNo doubt they rose up early to observe\\r\\nThe rite of May, and hearing our intent,\\r\\nCame here in grace of our solemnity.\\r\\nBut speak, Egeus. Is not this the day\\r\\nThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS  It is, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\\r\\n[A Servant exits.]\\r\\n[Shout within. Wind horns. They all start up.]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nGood morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past.\\r\\nBegin these woodbirds but to couple now?\\r\\n[Demetrius, Helena, Hermia, and Lysander kneel.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nPardon, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  I pray you all, stand up.\\r\\n[They rise.]\\r\\nI know you two are rival enemies.\\r\\nHow comes this gentle concord in the world,\\r\\nThat hatred is so far from jealousy\\r\\nTo sleep by hate and fear no enmity?\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nMy lord, I shall reply amazedly,\\r\\nHalf sleep, half waking. But as yet, I swear,\\r\\nI cannot truly say how I came here.\\r\\nBut, as I think--for truly would I speak,\\r\\nAnd now I do bethink me, so it is:\\r\\nI came with Hermia hither. Our intent\\r\\nWas to be gone from Athens, where we might,\\r\\nWithout the peril of the Athenian law--\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS\\r\\nEnough, enough!--My lord, you have enough.\\r\\nI beg the law, the law upon his head.\\r\\nThey would have stol\\'n away.--They would,\\r\\nDemetrius,\\r\\nThereby to have defeated you and me:\\r\\nYou of your wife and me of my consent,\\r\\nOf my consent that she should be your wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nMy lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,\\r\\nOf this their purpose hither to this wood,\\r\\nAnd I in fury hither followed them,\\r\\nFair Helena in fancy following me.\\r\\nBut, my good lord, I wot not by what power\\r\\n(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,\\r\\nMelted as the snow, seems to me now\\r\\nAs the remembrance of an idle gaud\\r\\nWhich in my childhood I did dote upon,\\r\\nAnd all the faith, the virtue of my heart,\\r\\nThe object and the pleasure of mine eye,\\r\\nIs only Helena. To her, my lord,\\r\\nWas I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.\\r\\nBut like a sickness did I loathe this food.\\r\\nBut, as in health, come to my natural taste,\\r\\nNow I do wish it, love it, long for it,\\r\\nAnd will forevermore be true to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nFair lovers, you are fortunately met.\\r\\nOf this discourse we more will hear anon.--\\r\\nEgeus, I will overbear your will,\\r\\nFor in the temple by and by, with us,\\r\\nThese couples shall eternally be knit.--\\r\\nAnd, for the morning now is something worn,\\r\\nOur purposed hunting shall be set aside.\\r\\nAway with us to Athens. Three and three,\\r\\nWe\\'ll hold a feast in great solemnity.\\r\\nCome, Hippolyta.\\r\\n[Theseus and his train,\\r\\nincluding Hippolyta and Egeus, exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nThese things seem small and undistinguishable,\\r\\nLike far-off mountains turned into clouds.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nMethinks I see these things with parted eye,\\r\\nWhen everything seems double.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA  So methinks.\\r\\nAnd I have found Demetrius like a jewel,\\r\\nMine own and not mine own.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS  Are you sure\\r\\nThat we are awake? It seems to me\\r\\nThat yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think\\r\\nThe Duke was here and bid us follow him?\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nYea, and my father.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA  And Hippolyta.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nAnd he did bid us follow to the temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nWhy, then, we are awake. Let\\'s follow him,\\r\\nAnd by the way let us recount our dreams.\\r\\n[Lovers exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM, [waking up]   When my cue comes, call me,\\r\\nand I will answer. My next is \"Most fair Pyramus.\"\\r\\nHey-ho! Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender!\\r\\nSnout the tinker! Starveling! God\\'s my life! Stolen\\r\\nhence and left me asleep! I have had a most rare\\r\\nvision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to say\\r\\nwhat dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about\\r\\nto expound this dream. Methought I was--there\\r\\nis no man can tell what. Methought I was and\\r\\nmethought I had--but man is but a patched fool if\\r\\nhe will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of\\r\\nman hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen,\\r\\nman\\'s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to\\r\\nconceive, nor his heart to report what my dream\\r\\nwas. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this\\r\\ndream. It shall be called \"Bottom\\'s Dream\" because\\r\\nit hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the\\r\\nlatter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure,\\r\\nto make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her\\r\\ndeath.\\r\\n[He exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nScene 2\\r\\n=======\\r\\n[Enter Quince, Flute, Snout, and Starveling.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Have you sent to Bottom\\'s house? Is he come\\r\\nhome yet?\\r\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING  He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he\\r\\nis transported.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLUTE  If he come not, then the play is marred. It goes\\r\\nnot forward, doth it?\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  It is not possible. You have not a man in all\\r\\nAthens able to discharge Pyramus but he.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLUTE  No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraftman\\r\\nin Athens.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Yea, and the best person too, and he is a very\\r\\nparamour for a sweet voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLUTE  You must say \"paragon.\" A \"paramour\" is (God\\r\\nbless us) a thing of naught.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Snug the joiner.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSNUG  Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple,\\r\\nand there is two or three lords and ladies more\\r\\nmarried. If our sport had gone forward, we had all\\r\\nbeen made men.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLUTE  O, sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence\\r\\na day during his life. He could not have\\r\\n\\'scaped sixpence a day. An the Duke had not given\\r\\nhim sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I\\'ll be\\r\\nhanged. He would have deserved it. Sixpence a day\\r\\nin Pyramus, or nothing!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Bottom.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Where are these lads? Where are these\\r\\nhearts?\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy\\r\\nhour!\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Masters, I am to discourse wonders. But ask\\r\\nme not what; for, if I tell you, I am not true\\r\\nAthenian. I will tell you everything right as it fell\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE  Let us hear, sweet Bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is that\\r\\nthe Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,\\r\\ngood strings to your beards, new ribbons to your\\r\\npumps. Meet presently at the palace. Every man\\r\\nlook o\\'er his part. For the short and the long is, our\\r\\nplay is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean\\r\\nlinen, and let not him that plays the lion pare his\\r\\nnails, for they shall hang out for the lion\\'s claws.\\r\\nAnd, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for\\r\\nwe are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt but\\r\\nto hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more\\r\\nwords. Away! Go, away!\\r\\n[They exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT 5\\r\\n=====\\r\\n\\r\\nScene 1\\r\\n=======\\r\\n[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, Lords, and\\r\\nAttendants.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA\\r\\n\\'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nMore strange than true. I never may believe\\r\\nThese antique fables nor these fairy toys.\\r\\nLovers and madmen have such seething brains,\\r\\nSuch shaping fantasies, that apprehend\\r\\nMore than cool reason ever comprehends.\\r\\nThe lunatic, the lover, and the poet\\r\\nAre of imagination all compact.\\r\\nOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold:\\r\\nThat is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,\\r\\nSees Helen\\'s beauty in a brow of Egypt.\\r\\nThe poet\\'s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\\r\\nDoth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to\\r\\nheaven,\\r\\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\\r\\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet\\'s pen\\r\\nTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing\\r\\nA local habitation and a name.\\r\\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination\\r\\nThat, if it would but apprehend some joy,\\r\\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy.\\r\\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\\r\\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear!\\r\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA\\r\\nBut all the story of the night told over,\\r\\nAnd all their minds transfigured so together,\\r\\nMore witnesseth than fancy\\'s images\\r\\nAnd grows to something of great constancy,\\r\\nBut, howsoever, strange and admirable.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nHere come the lovers full of joy and mirth.--\\r\\nJoy, gentle friends! Joy and fresh days of love\\r\\nAccompany your hearts!\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER  More than to us\\r\\nWait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nCome now, what masques, what dances shall we\\r\\nhave\\r\\nTo wear away this long age of three hours\\r\\nBetween our after-supper and bedtime?\\r\\nWhere is our usual manager of mirth?\\r\\nWhat revels are in hand? Is there no play\\r\\nTo ease the anguish of a torturing hour?\\r\\nCall Philostrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE, [coming forward]  Here, mighty Theseus.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nSay what abridgment have you for this evening,\\r\\nWhat masque, what music? How shall we beguile\\r\\nThe lazy time if not with some delight?\\r\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE, [giving Theseus a paper]\\r\\nThere is a brief how many sports are ripe.\\r\\nMake choice of which your Highness will see first.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\n\"The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung\\r\\nBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp.\"\\r\\nWe\\'ll none of that. That have I told my love\\r\\nIn glory of my kinsman Hercules.\\r\\n\"The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,\\r\\nTearing the Thracian singer in their rage.\"\\r\\nThat is an old device, and it was played\\r\\nWhen I from Thebes came last a conqueror.\\r\\n\"The thrice-three Muses mourning for the death\\r\\nOf learning, late deceased in beggary.\"\\r\\nThat is some satire, keen and critical,\\r\\nNot sorting with a nuptial ceremony.\\r\\n\"A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus\\r\\nAnd his love Thisbe, very tragical mirth.\"\\r\\n\"Merry\" and \"tragical\"? \"Tedious\" and \"brief\"?\\r\\nThat is hot ice and wondrous strange snow!\\r\\nHow shall we find the concord of this discord?\\r\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE\\r\\nA play there is, my lord, some ten words long\\r\\n(Which is as brief as I have known a play),\\r\\nBut by ten words, my lord, it is too long,\\r\\nWhich makes it tedious; for in all the play,\\r\\nThere is not one word apt, one player fitted.\\r\\nAnd tragical, my noble lord, it is.\\r\\nFor Pyramus therein doth kill himself,\\r\\nWhich, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,\\r\\nMade mine eyes water; but more merry tears\\r\\nThe passion of loud laughter never shed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nWhat are they that do play it?\\r\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE\\r\\nHard-handed men that work in Athens here,\\r\\nWhich never labored in their minds till now,\\r\\nAnd now have toiled their unbreathed memories\\r\\nWith this same play, against your nuptial.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nAnd we will hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE  No, my noble lord,\\r\\nIt is not for you. I have heard it over,\\r\\nAnd it is nothing, nothing in the world,\\r\\nUnless you can find sport in their intents,\\r\\nExtremely stretched and conned with cruel pain\\r\\nTo do you service.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  I will hear that play,\\r\\nFor never anything can be amiss\\r\\nWhen simpleness and duty tender it.\\r\\nGo, bring them in--and take your places, ladies.\\r\\n[Philostrate exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA\\r\\nI love not to see wretchedness o\\'ercharged,\\r\\nAnd duty in his service perishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nWhy, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA\\r\\nHe says they can do nothing in this kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nThe kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.\\r\\nOur sport shall be to take what they mistake;\\r\\nAnd what poor duty cannot do, noble respect\\r\\nTakes it in might, not merit.\\r\\nWhere I have come, great clerks have purposed\\r\\nTo greet me with premeditated welcomes,\\r\\nWhere I have seen them shiver and look pale,\\r\\nMake periods in the midst of sentences,\\r\\nThrottle their practiced accent in their fears,\\r\\nAnd in conclusion dumbly have broke off,\\r\\nNot paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,\\r\\nOut of this silence yet I picked a welcome,\\r\\nAnd in the modesty of fearful duty,\\r\\nI read as much as from the rattling tongue\\r\\nOf saucy and audacious eloquence.\\r\\nLove, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity\\r\\nIn least speak most, to my capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Philostrate.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE\\r\\nSo please your Grace, the Prologue is addressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  Let him approach.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter the Prologue.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROLOGUE\\r\\nIf we offend, it is with our goodwill.\\r\\n   That you should think we come not to offend,\\r\\nBut with goodwill. To show our simple skill,\\r\\n   That is the true beginning of our end.\\r\\nConsider, then, we come but in despite.\\r\\n   We do not come, as minding to content you,\\r\\nOur true intent is. All for your delight\\r\\n   We are not here. That you should here repent\\r\\n   you,\\r\\nThe actors are at hand, and, by their show,\\r\\nYou shall know all that you are like to know.\\r\\n[Prologue exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  This fellow doth not stand upon points.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER  He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt;\\r\\nhe knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is\\r\\nnot enough to speak, but to speak true.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA  Indeed he hath played on this prologue like\\r\\na child on a recorder--a sound, but not in\\r\\ngovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  His speech was like a tangled chain--nothing\\r\\nimpaired, but all disordered. Who is next?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Pyramus (Bottom), and Thisbe (Flute), and\\r\\nWall (Snout), and Moonshine (Starveling), and Lion\\r\\n(Snug), and Prologue (Quince).]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINCE, [as Prologue]\\r\\nGentles, perchance you wonder at this show.\\r\\n   But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.\\r\\nThis man is Pyramus, if you would know.\\r\\n   This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.\\r\\nThis man with lime and roughcast doth present\\r\\n   \"Wall,\" that vile wall which did these lovers\\r\\n   sunder;\\r\\nAnd through Wall\\'s chink, poor souls, they are\\r\\ncontent\\r\\n   To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.\\r\\nThis man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,\\r\\n   Presenteth \"Moonshine,\" for, if you will know,\\r\\nBy moonshine did these lovers think no scorn\\r\\n   To meet at Ninus\\' tomb, there, there to woo.\\r\\nThis grisly beast (which \"Lion\" hight by name)\\r\\n   The trusty Thisbe coming first by night\\r\\nDid scare away or rather did affright;\\r\\nAnd, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,\\r\\n   Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.\\r\\nAnon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,\\r\\n   And finds his trusty Thisbe\\'s mantle slain.\\r\\nWhereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,\\r\\n   He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast.\\r\\nAnd Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,\\r\\n   His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,\\r\\nLet Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain\\r\\nAt large discourse, while here they do remain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  I wonder if the lion be to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS  No wonder, my lord. One lion may when\\r\\nmany asses do.\\r\\n[Lion, Thisbe, Moonshine, and Prologue exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOUT, [as Wall]\\r\\nIn this same interlude it doth befall\\r\\nThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall;\\r\\nAnd such a wall as I would have you think\\r\\nThat had in it a crannied hole or chink,\\r\\nThrough which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,\\r\\nDid whisper often, very secretly.\\r\\nThis loam, this roughcast, and this stone doth show\\r\\nThat I am that same wall. The truth is so.\\r\\nAnd this the cranny is, right and sinister,\\r\\nThrough which the fearful lovers are to whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  Would you desire lime and hair to speak\\r\\nbetter?\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS  It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard\\r\\ndiscourse, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  Pyramus draws near the wall. Silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM, [as Pyramus]\\r\\nO grim-looked night! O night with hue so black!\\r\\n   O night, which ever art when day is not!\\r\\nO night! O night! Alack, alack, alack!\\r\\n   I fear my Thisbe\\'s promise is forgot.\\r\\nAnd thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,\\r\\n   That stand\\'st between her father\\'s ground and\\r\\n   mine,\\r\\nThou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,\\r\\n   Show me thy chink to blink through with mine\\r\\n   eyne.\\r\\nThanks, courteous wall.

No Thisbe do I see.\\r\\nO wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,\\r\\n   Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  The wall, methinks, being sensible, should\\r\\ncurse again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM  No, in truth, sir, he should not. \"Deceiving\\r\\nme\" is Thisbe\\'s cue. She is to enter now, and I am\\r\\nto spy her through the wall. You shall see it will fall\\r\\npat as I told you. Yonder she comes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Thisbe (Flute).]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFLUTE, [as Thisbe]\\r\\nO wall, full often hast thou heard my moans\\r\\n   For parting my fair Pyramus and me.\\r\\nMy cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,\\r\\n   Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM, [as Pyramus]\\r\\nI see a voice!

Here\\r\\ncome two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Lion (Snug) and Moonshine (Starveling).]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSNUG, [as Lion]\\r\\nYou ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear\\r\\n   The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on\\r\\n   floor,\\r\\nMay now perchance both quake and tremble here,\\r\\n   When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.\\r\\nThen know that I, as Snug the joiner, am\\r\\nA lion fell, nor else no lion\\'s dam;\\r\\nFor if I should as lion come in strife\\r\\nInto this place, \\'twere pity on my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  A very gentle beast, and of a good\\r\\nconscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS  The very best at a beast, my lord, that e\\'er I\\r\\nsaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER  This lion is a very fox for his valor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  True, and a goose for his discretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS  Not so, my lord, for his valor cannot carry\\r\\nhis discretion, and the fox carries the goose.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his\\r\\nvalor, for the goose carries not the fox. It is well.\\r\\nLeave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the\\r\\nMoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING, [as Moonshine]\\r\\nThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS  He should have worn the horns on his\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible\\r\\nwithin the circumference.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING, [as Moonshine]\\r\\nThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present.\\r\\nMyself the man i\\' th\\' moon do seem to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  This is the greatest error of all the rest; the\\r\\nman should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else\\r\\n\"the man i\\' th\\' moon\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS  He dares not come there for the candle,\\r\\nfor you see, it is already in snuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA  I am aweary of this moon. Would he would\\r\\nchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  It appears by his small light of discretion that\\r\\nhe is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason,\\r\\nwe must stay the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER  Proceed, Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING, [as Moonshine]   All that I have to say is to tell\\r\\nyou that the lanthorn is the moon, I the man i\\' th\\'\\r\\nmoon, this thornbush my thornbush, and this dog\\r\\nmy dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS  Why, all these should be in the lanthorn,\\r\\nfor all these are in the moon.

Thisbe runs off,\\r\\ndropping her mantle.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS  Well roared, Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  Well run, Thisbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA  Well shone, Moon.

Four happy days bring in\\r\\nAnother moon. But, O, methinks how slow\\r\\nThis old moon wanes! She lingers my desires\\r\\nLike to a stepdame or a dowager\\r\\nLong withering out a young man\\'s revenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA\\r\\nFour days will quickly steep themselves in night;\\r\\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\\r\\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\\r\\nNew-bent in heaven, shall behold the night\\r\\nOf our solemnities.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  Go, Philostrate,\\r\\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments.\\r\\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.\\r\\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals;\\r\\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp.\\r\\n[Philostrate exits.]\\r\\nHippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword\\r\\nAnd won thy love doing thee injuries,\\r\\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\\r\\nWith pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander \\r\\n and Demetrius.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS\\r\\nHappy be Theseus, our renowned duke!\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nThanks, good Egeus. What\\'s the news with thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS\\r\\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\\r\\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.--\\r\\nStand forth, Demetrius.--My noble lord,\\r\\nThis man hath my consent to marry her.--\\r\\nStand forth, Lysander.--And, my gracious duke,\\r\\nThis man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.--\\r\\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes\\r\\nAnd interchanged love tokens with my child.\\r\\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung\\r\\nWith feigning voice verses of feigning love\\r\\nAnd stol\\'n the impression of her fantasy\\r\\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,\\r\\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats--messengers\\r\\nOf strong prevailment in unhardened youth.\\r\\nWith cunning hast thou filched my daughter\\'s heart,\\r\\nTurned her obedience (which is due to me)\\r\\nTo stubborn harshness.--And, my gracious duke,\\r\\nBe it so she will not here before your Grace\\r\\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\\r\\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens:\\r\\nAs she is mine, I may dispose of her,\\r\\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\\r\\nOr to her death, according to our law\\r\\nImmediately provided in that case.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nWhat say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.\\r\\nTo you, your father should be as a god,\\r\\nOne that composed your beauties, yea, and one\\r\\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\\r\\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\\r\\nTo leave the figure or disfigure it.\\r\\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nSo is Lysander.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS  In himself he is,\\r\\nBut in this kind, wanting your father\\'s voice,\\r\\nThe other must be held the worthier.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI would my father looked but with my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\\r\\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\\r\\nNor how it may concern my modesty\\r\\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts;\\r\\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\\r\\nThe worst that may befall me in this case\\r\\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nEither to die the death or to abjure\\r\\nForever the society of men.\\r\\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\\r\\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\\r\\nWhether (if you yield not to your father\\'s choice)\\r\\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\\r\\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mewed,\\r\\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\\r\\nChanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.\\r\\nThrice-blessed they that master so their blood\\r\\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage,\\r\\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distilled\\r\\nThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\\r\\nGrows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nSo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\\r\\nEre I will yield my virgin patent up\\r\\nUnto his Lordship whose unwished yoke\\r\\nMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nTake time to pause, and by the next new moon\\r\\n(The sealing day betwixt my love and me\\r\\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship),\\r\\nUpon that day either prepare to die\\r\\nFor disobedience to your father\\'s will,\\r\\nOr else to wed Demetrius, as he would,\\r\\nOr on Diana\\'s altar to protest\\r\\nFor aye austerity and single life.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS\\r\\nRelent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield\\r\\nThy crazed title to my certain right.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nYou have her father\\'s love, Demetrius.\\r\\nLet me have Hermia\\'s. Do you marry him.\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS\\r\\nScornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;\\r\\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him.\\r\\nAnd she is mine, and all my right of her\\r\\nI do estate unto Demetrius.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER, [to Theseus]\\r\\nI am, my lord, as well derived as he,\\r\\nAs well possessed. My love is more than his;\\r\\nMy fortunes every way as fairly ranked\\r\\n(If not with vantage) as Demetrius\\';\\r\\nAnd (which is more than all these boasts can be)\\r\\nI am beloved of beauteous Hermia.\\r\\nWhy should not I then prosecute my right?\\r\\nDemetrius, I\\'ll avouch it to his head,\\r\\nMade love to Nedar\\'s daughter, Helena,\\r\\nAnd won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\\r\\nDevoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,\\r\\nUpon this spotted and inconstant man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS\\r\\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\\r\\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\\r\\nBut, being overfull of self-affairs,\\r\\nMy mind did lose it.--But, Demetrius, come,\\r\\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me.\\r\\nI have some private schooling for you both.--\\r\\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\\r\\nTo fit your fancies to your father\\'s will,\\r\\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up\\r\\n(Which by no means we may extenuate)\\r\\nTo death or to a vow of single life.--\\r\\nCome, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?--\\r\\nDemetrius and Egeus, go along.\\r\\nI must employ you in some business\\r\\nAgainst our nuptial and confer with you\\r\\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nEGEUS\\r\\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\\r\\n[All but Hermia and Lysander exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nHow now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?\\r\\nHow chance the roses there do fade so fast?\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nBelike for want of rain, which I could well\\r\\nBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nAy me! For aught that I could ever read,\\r\\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\\r\\nThe course of true love never did run smooth.\\r\\nBut either it was different in blood--\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nO cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nOr else misgraffed in respect of years--\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nO spite! Too old to be engaged to young.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nOr else it stood upon the choice of friends--\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nO hell, to choose love by another\\'s eyes!\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nOr, if there were a sympathy in choice,\\r\\nWar, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,\\r\\nMaking it momentany as a sound,\\r\\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream,\\r\\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night,\\r\\nThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth,\\r\\nAnd, ere a man hath power to say \"Behold!\"\\r\\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up.\\r\\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nIf then true lovers have been ever crossed,\\r\\nIt stands as an edict in destiny.\\r\\nThen let us teach our trial patience\\r\\nBecause it is a customary cross,\\r\\nAs due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,\\r\\nWishes and tears, poor fancy\\'s followers.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nA good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:\\r\\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\\r\\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child.\\r\\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues,\\r\\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\\r\\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;\\r\\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\\r\\nCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then\\r\\nSteal forth thy father\\'s house tomorrow night,\\r\\nAnd in the wood a league without the town\\r\\n(Where I did meet thee once with Helena\\r\\nTo do observance to a morn of May),\\r\\nThere will I stay for thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA  My good Lysander,\\r\\nI swear to thee by Cupid\\'s strongest bow,\\r\\nBy his best arrow with the golden head,\\r\\nBy the simplicity of Venus\\' doves,\\r\\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\\r\\nAnd by that fire which burned the Carthage queen\\r\\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,\\r\\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke\\r\\n(In number more than ever women spoke),\\r\\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me,\\r\\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Helena.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nGodspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nCall you me \"fair\"? That \"fair\" again unsay.\\r\\nDemetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!\\r\\nYour eyes are lodestars and your tongue\\'s sweet air\\r\\nMore tunable than lark to shepherd\\'s ear\\r\\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\\r\\nSickness is catching. O, were favor so!\\r\\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.\\r\\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;\\r\\nMy tongue should catch your tongue\\'s sweet\\r\\nmelody.\\r\\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\\r\\nThe rest I\\'d give to be to you translated.\\r\\nO, teach me how you look and with what art\\r\\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius\\' heart!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nO, that your frowns would teach my smiles such\\r\\nskill!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nO, that my prayers could such affection move!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nNone but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nTake comfort: he no more shall see my face.\\r\\nLysander and myself will fly this place.\\r\\nBefore the time I did Lysander see\\r\\nSeemed Athens as a paradise to me.\\r\\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell\\r\\nThat he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold.\\r\\nTomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold\\r\\nHer silver visage in the wat\\'ry glass,\\r\\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass\\r\\n(A time that lovers\\' flights doth still conceal),\\r\\nThrough Athens\\' gates have we devised to steal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIA\\r\\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\\r\\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\\r\\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\\r\\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet\\r\\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes\\r\\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\\r\\nFarewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\\r\\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.--\\r\\nKeep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\\r\\nFrom lovers\\' food till morrow deep midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER\\r\\nI will, my Hermia.\\t[Hermia exits.]\\r\\nHelena, adieu.\\r\\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\\r\\n[Lysander exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nHow happy some o\\'er other some can be!\\r\\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\\r\\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.\\r\\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\\r\\nAnd, as he errs, doting on Hermia\\'s eyes,\\r\\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\\r\\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\\r\\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\\r\\nLove looks not with the eyes but with the mind;\\r\\nAnd therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\\r\\nNor hath Love\\'s mind of any judgment taste.\\r\\nWings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.\\r\\nAnd therefore is Love said to be a child\\r\\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguiled.\\r\\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\\r\\nSo the boy Love is perjured everywhere.\\r\\nFor, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia\\'s eyne,\\r\\nHe hailed down oaths that he was only mine;\\r\\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\\r\\nSo he dissolved, and show\\'rs of oaths did melt.\\r\\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia\\'s flight.\\r\\nThen to the wood will he tomorrow night\\r\\nPursue her. And, for this intelligence\\r\\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.\\r\\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\\r\\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\\r\\n[She exits.]\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

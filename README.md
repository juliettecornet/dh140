## Juliette Cornet
Hi, my name is Juliette Cornet and I'm a fourth year Comparative Literature major with a double minor in Professional Writing and French. Although I have no background in coding, I'm verry excited to learn some basics before I graduate. I'm hoping to find a job in entertainment on the production side after I graduate. 

### Course Description 
Based on the first class, I believe this course with teach me how to use code (in particular python) to collect data and make analysis on a wide variety of subjects in relation to humanities. 

### Project Ideas 
I'm not entirely sure I have I understand what kind of prject we're doing but I'm hoping that I can somehow use data collected from books to discover what is popular in literature right now that would make for a good film adaption. Maybe by comparing certain data between a successful book to film adaption (like The Hunger Games) to a book that hasn't been adapted yet to see if it could be a sucess or not. I'm sure if that makes sense but that's my base idea so far. 

### Class Objectives 
In this class I'm hoping to become proficient enough in coding that I'm not completely illiterate in the future when understadning code will be apart of basic education.

What’s the news with thee?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEGEUS.\\r\\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\\r\\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.\\r\\nStand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,\\r\\nThis man hath my consent to marry her.\\r\\nStand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,\\r\\nThis man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.\\r\\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,\\r\\nAnd interchang’d love-tokens with my child.\\r\\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung,\\r\\nWith feigning voice, verses of feigning love;\\r\\nAnd stol’n the impression of her fantasy\\r\\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,\\r\\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers\\r\\nOf strong prevailment in unharden’d youth)\\r\\nWith cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,\\r\\nTurn’d her obedience (which is due to me)\\r\\nTo stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,\\r\\nBe it so she will not here before your grace\\r\\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\\r\\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens:\\r\\nAs she is mine I may dispose of her;\\r\\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\\r\\nOr to her death, according to our law\\r\\nImmediately provided in that case.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nWhat say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.\\r\\nTo you your father should be as a god;\\r\\nOne that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one\\r\\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\\r\\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\\r\\nTo leave the figure, or disfigure it.\\r\\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nSo is Lysander.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nIn himself he is.\\r\\nBut in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,\\r\\nThe other must be held the worthier.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nI would my father look’d but with my eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\\r\\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\\r\\nNor how it may concern my modesty\\r\\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts:\\r\\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\\r\\nThe worst that may befall me in this case,\\r\\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nEither to die the death, or to abjure\\r\\nFor ever the society of men.\\r\\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\\r\\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\\r\\nWhether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,\\r\\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\\r\\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,\\r\\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\\r\\nChanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.\\r\\nThrice-blessèd they that master so their blood\\r\\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage,\\r\\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distill’d\\r\\nThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\\r\\nGrows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nSo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\\r\\nEre I will yield my virgin patent up\\r\\nUnto his lordship, whose unwishèd yoke\\r\\nMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nTake time to pause; and by the next new moon\\r\\nThe sealing-day betwixt my love and me\\r\\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship,\\r\\nUpon that day either prepare to die\\r\\nFor disobedience to your father’s will,\\r\\nOr else to wed Demetrius, as he would,\\r\\nOr on Diana’s altar to protest\\r\\nFor aye austerity and single life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS.\\r\\nRelent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield\\r\\nThy crazèd title to my certain right.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nYou have her father’s love, Demetrius.\\r\\nLet me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEGEUS.\\r\\nScornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;\\r\\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him;\\r\\nAnd she is mine, and all my right of her\\r\\nI do estate unto Demetrius.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nI am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,\\r\\nAs well possess’d; my love is more than his;\\r\\nMy fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,\\r\\nIf not with vantage, as Demetrius’;\\r\\nAnd, which is more than all these boasts can be,\\r\\nI am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.\\r\\nWhy should not I then prosecute my right?\\r\\nDemetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,\\r\\nMade love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,\\r\\nAnd won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\\r\\nDevoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,\\r\\nUpon this spotted and inconstant man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\\r\\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\\r\\nBut, being over-full of self-affairs,\\r\\nMy mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,\\r\\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me.\\r\\nI have some private schooling for you both.—\\r\\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\\r\\nTo fit your fancies to your father’s will,\\r\\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up\\r\\n(Which by no means we may extenuate)\\r\\nTo death, or to a vow of single life.\\r\\nCome, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?\\r\\nDemetrius and Egeus, go along;\\r\\nI must employ you in some business\\r\\nAgainst our nuptial, and confer with you\\r\\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEGEUS.\\r\\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\\r\\n\\n [Exeunt all but Lysander and\\r\\nHermia.]\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nHow now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?\\r\\nHow chance the roses there do fade so fast?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nBelike for want of rain, which I could well\\r\\nBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nAy me! For aught that I could ever read,\\r\\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\\r\\nThe course of true love never did run smooth.\\r\\nBut either it was different in blood—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nO cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nOr else misgraffèd in respect of years—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nO spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nOr else it stood upon the choice of friends—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nO hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nOr, if there were a sympathy in choice,\\r\\nWar, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,\\r\\nMaking it momentany as a sound,\\r\\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream,\\r\\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night\\r\\nThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,\\r\\nAnd, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’\\r\\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up:\\r\\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nIf then true lovers have ever cross’d,\\r\\nIt stands as an edict in destiny.\\r\\nThen let us teach our trial patience,\\r\\nBecause it is a customary cross,\\r\\nAs due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,\\r\\nWishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nA good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.\\r\\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\\r\\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child.\\r\\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues,\\r\\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\\r\\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,\\r\\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\\r\\nCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,\\r\\nSteal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;\\r\\nAnd in the wood, a league without the town\\r\\n(Where I did meet thee once with Helena\\r\\nTo do observance to a morn of May),\\r\\nThere will I stay for thee.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nMy good Lysander!\\r\\nI swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,\\r\\nBy his best arrow with the golden head,\\r\\nBy the simplicity of Venus’ doves,\\r\\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\\r\\nAnd by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen\\r\\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,\\r\\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke\\r\\n(In number more than ever women spoke),\\r\\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me,\\r\\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\\r\\n\\n Enter Helena.\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nGod speed fair Helena! Whither away?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nCall you me fair? That fair again unsay.\\r\\nDemetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!\\r\\nYour eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air\\r\\nMore tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,\\r\\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\\r\\nSickness is catching. O were favour so,\\r\\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.\\r\\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,\\r\\nMy tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.\\r\\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\\r\\nThe rest I’d give to be to you translated.\\r\\nO, teach me how you look, and with what art\\r\\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nO that my prayers could such affection move!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nNone but your beauty; would that fault were mine!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nTake comfort: he no more shall see my face;\\r\\nLysander and myself will fly this place.\\r\\nBefore the time I did Lysander see,\\r\\nSeem’d Athens as a paradise to me.\\r\\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell,\\r\\nThat he hath turn’d a heaven into hell!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold:\\r\\nTomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\\r\\nHer silver visage in the watery glass,\\r\\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass\\r\\n(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),\\r\\nThrough Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\\r\\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\\r\\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\\r\\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet,\\r\\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes,\\r\\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\\r\\nFarewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\\r\\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!\\r\\nKeep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\\r\\nFrom lovers’ food, till morrow deep midnight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nI will, my Hermia.\\n\\n [Exit Hermia.]\\n\\r\\nHelena, adieu.\\r\\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\\r\\n\\n [Exit Lysander.]\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nHow happy some o’er other some can be!\\r\\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\\r\\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;\\r\\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\\r\\nAnd as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,\\r\\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\\r\\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\\r\\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\\r\\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;\\r\\nAnd therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.\\r\\nNor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste.\\r\\nWings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.\\r\\nAnd therefore is love said to be a child,\\r\\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguil’d.\\r\\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\\r\\nSo the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.\\r\\nFor, ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,\\r\\nHe hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;\\r\\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\\r\\nSo he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt.\\r\\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.\\r\\nThen to the wood will he tomorrow night\\r\\nPursue her; and for this intelligence\\r\\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.\\r\\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\\r\\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\\r\\n\\n [Exit Helena.]\\n\\nSCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage\\n Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute,\\r\\nSnout  and Starveling.\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nIs all our company here?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nYou were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nHere is the scroll of every man’s name, which is thought fit through all\\r\\nAthens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and Duchess, on his wedding-day\\r\\nat night.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nFirst, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of\\r\\nthe actors; and so grow to a point.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nMarry, our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of\\r\\nPyramus and Thisbe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nA very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince,\\r\\ncall forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nAnswer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nReady. Name what part I am for, and proceed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nWhat is Pyramus—a lover, or a tyrant?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nA lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nThat will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the\\r\\naudience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some\\r\\nmeasure. To the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could play\\r\\nErcles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.\\n\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The raging rocks\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0And shivering shocks\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Shall break the locks\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Of prison gates,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0And Phibbus’ car\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Shall shine from far,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0And make and mar\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The foolish Fates.\\r\\nThis was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein, a\\r\\ntyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFLUTE.\\r\\nHere, Peter Quince.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nFlute, you must take Thisbe on you.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFLUTE.\\r\\nWhat is Thisbe? A wandering knight?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFLUTE.\\r\\nNay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nThat’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small\\r\\nas you will.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nAnd I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a monstrous\\r\\nlittle voice; ‘Thisne, Thisne!’—‘Ah, Pyramus, my lover\\r\\ndear! thy Thisbe dear! and lady dear!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nNo, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nWell, proceed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nRobin Starveling, the tailor.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING.\\r\\nHere, Peter Quince.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nRobin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother.\\r\\nTom Snout, the tinker.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSNOUT\\r\\nHere, Peter Quince.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nYou, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father;\\r\\nSnug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. And, I hope here is a play\\r\\nfitted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSNUG\\r\\nHave you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I\\r\\nam slow of study.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nLet me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart good\\r\\nto hear me. I will roar that I will make the Duke say ‘Let him roar\\r\\nagain, let him roar again.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nIf you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies,\\r\\nthat they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nALL\\r\\nThat would hang us every mother’s son.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nI grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they\\r\\nwould have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my voice so,\\r\\nthat I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an\\r\\n’twere any nightingale.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nYou can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper\\r\\nman as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely gentleman-like\\r\\nman. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nWhy, what you will.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nI will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard,\\r\\nyour purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your perfect\\r\\nyellow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play\\r\\nbare-faced. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you, request\\r\\nyou, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me in the palace\\r\\nwood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if we\\r\\nmeet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with company, and our devices known.\\r\\nIn the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I\\r\\npray you fail me not.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nWe will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take\\r\\npains, be perfect; adieu.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nAt the Duke’s oak we meet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nEnough. Hold, or cut bow-strings.\\r\\n\\n [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT II\\nSCENE I. A wood near Athens\\n Enter a Fairy at one door, and\\r\\nPuck at another.\\n\\r\\nPUCK.\\r\\nHow now, spirit!

Fairies, skip hence;\\r\\nI have forsworn his bed and company.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nTarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTITANIA.\\r\\nThen I must be thy lady; but I know\\r\\nWhen thou hast stol’n away from fairyland,\\r\\nAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day\\r\\nPlaying on pipes of corn, and versing love\\r\\nTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\\r\\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\\r\\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\\r\\nYour buskin’d mistress and your warrior love,\\r\\nTo Theseus must be wedded; and you come\\r\\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nHow canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,\\r\\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\\r\\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\\r\\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering night\\r\\nFrom Perigenia, whom he ravished?\\r\\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\\r\\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTITANIA.\\r\\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy:\\r\\nAnd never, since the middle summer’s spring,\\r\\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\\r\\nBy pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook,\\r\\nOr on the beachèd margent of the sea,\\r\\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\\r\\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.\\r\\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\\r\\nAs in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea\\r\\nContagious fogs; which, falling in the land,\\r\\nHath every pelting river made so proud\\r\\nThat they have overborne their continents.\\r\\nThe ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,\\r\\nThe ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn\\r\\nHath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard.\\r\\nThe fold stands empty in the drownèd field,\\r\\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrion flock;\\r\\nThe nine-men’s-morris is fill’d up with mud,\\r\\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\\r\\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable.\\r\\nThe human mortals want their winter here.\\r\\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blest.\\r\\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\\r\\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\\r\\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound.\\r\\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\\r\\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\\r\\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;\\r\\nAnd on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown\\r\\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\\r\\nIs, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,\\r\\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\\r\\nTheir wonted liveries; and the mazed world,\\r\\nBy their increase, now knows not which is which.\\r\\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\\r\\nFrom our debate, from our dissension;\\r\\nWe are their parents and original.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nDo you amend it, then.

Thou shalt not from this grove\\r\\nTill I torment thee for this injury.—\\r\\nMy gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest\\r\\nSince once I sat upon a promontory,\\r\\nAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back\\r\\nUttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\\r\\nThat the rude sea grew civil at her song\\r\\nAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheres\\r\\nTo hear the sea-maid’s music.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPUCK.\\r\\nI remember.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nThat very time I saw, (but thou couldst not),\\r\\nFlying between the cold moon and the earth,\\r\\nCupid all arm’d: a certain aim he took\\r\\nAt a fair vestal, thronèd by the west,\\r\\nAnd loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow\\r\\nAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.\\r\\nBut I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft\\r\\nQuench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon;\\r\\nAnd the imperial votress passed on,\\r\\nIn maiden meditation, fancy-free.\\r\\nYet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:\\r\\nIt fell upon a little western flower,\\r\\nBefore milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,\\r\\nAnd maidens call it love-in-idleness.\\r\\nFetch me that flower, the herb I showed thee once:\\r\\nThe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\\r\\nWill make or man or woman madly dote\\r\\nUpon the next live creature that it sees.\\r\\nFetch me this herb, and be thou here again\\r\\nEre the leviathan can swim a league.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPUCK.\\r\\nI’ll put a girdle round about the earth\\r\\nIn forty minutes.\\r\\n\\n [Exit Puck.]\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nHaving once this juice,\\r\\nI’ll watch Titania when she is asleep,\\r\\nAnd drop the liquor of it in her eyes:\\r\\nThe next thing then she waking looks upon\\r\\n(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,\\r\\nOn meddling monkey, or on busy ape)\\r\\nShe shall pursue it with the soul of love.\\r\\nAnd ere I take this charm from off her sight\\r\\n(As I can take it with another herb)\\r\\nI’ll make her render up her page to me.\\r\\nBut who comes here? I am invisible;\\r\\nAnd I will overhear their conference.\\r\\n\\n Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS.\\r\\nI love thee not, therefore pursue me not.\\r\\nWhere is Lysander and fair Hermia?\\r\\nThe one I’ll slay, the other slayeth me.\\r\\nThou told’st me they were stol’n into this wood,\\r\\nAnd here am I, and wode within this wood\\r\\nBecause I cannot meet with Hermia.\\r\\nHence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nYou draw me, you hard-hearted adamant,\\r\\nBut yet you draw not iron, for my heart\\r\\nIs true as steel.

The Wood.\\n The Queen of Fairies still lying asleep.\\n Enter Bottom, Quince, Snout,\\r\\nStarveling, Snug and Flute.\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nAre we all met?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nPat, pat; and here’s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal.\\r\\nThis green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house; and\\r\\nwe will do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nPeter Quince?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nWhat sayest thou, bully Bottom?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nThere are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please.\\r\\nFirst, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot\\r\\nabide. How answer you that?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSNOUT\\r\\nBy’r lakin, a parlous fear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING.\\r\\nI believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nNot a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the\\r\\nprologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is\\r\\nnot killed indeed; and for the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus\\r\\nam not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nWell, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight and\\r\\nsix.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nNo, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSNOUT\\r\\nWill not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING.\\r\\nI fear it, I promise you.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nMasters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield us!) a\\r\\nlion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful\\r\\nwild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSNOUT\\r\\nTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nNay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the\\r\\nlion’s neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the\\r\\nsame defect: ‘Ladies,’ or, ‘Fair ladies, I would wish\\r\\nyou,’ or, ‘I would request you,’ or, ’I would entreat\\r\\nyou, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither\\r\\nas a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other\\r\\nmen are’: and there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly\\r\\nhe is Snug the joiner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nWell, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the\\r\\nmoonlight into a chamber, for you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by\\r\\nmoonlight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSNOUT\\r\\nDoth the moon shine that night we play our play?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nA calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find out\\r\\nmoonshine.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nYes, it doth shine that night.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nWhy, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where we play,\\r\\nopen; and the moon may shine in at the casement.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nAy; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he\\r\\ncomes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine. Then there is another\\r\\nthing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisbe, says\\r\\nthe story, did talk through the chink of a wall.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSNOUT\\r\\nYou can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nSome man or other must present Wall. And let him have some plaster, or some\\r\\nloam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his\\r\\nfingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nIf that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and\\r\\nrehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your speech,\\r\\nenter into that brake; and so everyone according to his cue.\\r\\n\\n Enter Puck behind.\\n\\r\\nPUCK.\\r\\nWhat hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,\\r\\nSo near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?\\r\\nWhat, a play toward? I’ll be an auditor;\\r\\nAn actor too perhaps, if I see cause.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nSpeak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, stand forth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPYRAMUS.\\nThisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nOdours, odours.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPYRAMUS.\\n. . . odours savours sweet.\\r\\nSo hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.\\r\\nBut hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,\\r\\nAnd by and by I will to thee appear.\\n\\n [Exit.]\\n\\r\\nPUCK.\\r\\nA stranger Pyramus than e’er played here!\\r\\n\\n [Exit.]\\n\\r\\nTHISBE.\\r\\nMust I speak now?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nAy, marry, must you, For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he\\r\\nheard, and is to come again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHISBE.\\nMost radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,\\r\\nOf colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,\\r\\nMost brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,\\r\\nAs true as truest horse, that yet would never tire,\\r\\nI’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb.\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nNinus’ tomb, man! Why, you must not speak that yet. That you answer to\\r\\nPyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues, and all.—Pyramus enter!\\r\\nYour cue is past; it is ‘never tire.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHISBE.\\r\\nO, As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.\\n\\n Enter Puck and\\r\\nBottom with an ass’s head.\\n\\r\\nPYRAMUS.\\nIf I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine.\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nO monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters, fly, masters! Help!\\r\\n\\n [Exeunt Clowns.]\\n\\r\\nPUCK.\\r\\nI’ll follow you. I’ll lead you about a round,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier;\\r\\nSometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;\\r\\nAnd neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,\\r\\nLike horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.\\r\\n\\n [Exit.]\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nWhy do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me afeard.\\r\\n\\n Enter Snout.\\n\\r\\nSNOUT\\r\\nO Bottom, thou art changed! What do I see on thee?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nWhat do you see? You see an ass-head of your own, do you?\\r\\n\\n [Exit Snout.]\\n Enter Quince.\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nBless thee, Bottom! bless thee! Thou art translated.\\r\\n\\n [Exit.]\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nI see their knavery. This is to make an ass of me, to fright me, if they could.\\r\\nBut I will not stir from this place, do what they can. I will walk up and down\\r\\nhere, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.\\r\\n[Sings.]\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The ousel cock, so black of hue,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0With orange-tawny bill,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The throstle with his note so true,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The wren with little quill.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTITANIA.\\r\\n[Waking.] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\n[Sings.]\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The plain-song cuckoo gray,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Whose note full many a man doth mark,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0And dares not answer nay.\\r\\nfor, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?

Another part of the wood\\n Enter Oberon.\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nI wonder if Titania be awak’d;\\r\\nThen, what it was that next came in her eye,\\r\\nWhich she must dote on in extremity.\\r\\n\\n Enter Puck.\\n\\r\\nHere comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit?\\r\\nWhat night-rule now about this haunted grove?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPUCK.\\r\\nMy mistress with a monster is in love.\\r\\nNear to her close and consecrated bower,\\r\\nWhile she was in her dull and sleeping hour,\\r\\nA crew of patches, rude mechanicals,\\r\\nThat work for bread upon Athenian stalls,\\r\\nWere met together to rehearse a play\\r\\nIntended for great Theseus’ nuptial day.\\r\\nThe shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort\\r\\nWho Pyramus presented in their sport,\\r\\nForsook his scene and enter’d in a brake.\\r\\nWhen I did him at this advantage take,\\r\\nAn ass’s nole I fixed on his head.\\r\\nAnon, his Thisbe must be answerèd,\\r\\nAnd forth my mimic comes.

Do not fret yourself too much in the action, monsieur; and, good\\r\\nmonsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be loath to have you\\r\\noverflown with a honey-bag, signior.

Seest thou this sweet sight?\\r\\nHer dotage now I do begin to pity.\\r\\nFor, meeting her of late behind the wood,\\r\\nSeeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,\\r\\nI did upbraid her and fall out with her:\\r\\nFor she his hairy temples then had rounded\\r\\nWith coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;\\r\\nAnd that same dew, which sometime on the buds\\r\\nWas wont to swell like round and orient pearls,\\r\\nStood now within the pretty flouriets’ eyes,\\r\\nLike tears that did their own disgrace bewail.\\r\\nWhen I had at my pleasure taunted her,\\r\\nAnd she in mild terms begg’d my patience,\\r\\nI then did ask of her her changeling child;\\r\\nWhich straight she gave me, and her fairy sent\\r\\nTo bear him to my bower in fairyland.\\r\\nAnd now I have the boy, I will undo\\r\\nThis hateful imperfection of her eyes.\\r\\nAnd, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalp\\r\\nFrom off the head of this Athenian swain,\\r\\nThat he awaking when the other do,\\r\\nMay all to Athens back again repair,\\r\\nAnd think no more of this night’s accidents\\r\\nBut as the fierce vexation of a dream.\\r\\nBut first I will release the Fairy Queen.\\n\\n [Touching her eyes with an herb.]\\n\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Be as thou wast wont to be;\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0See as thou was wont to see.\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Dian’s bud o’er Cupid’s flower\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Hath such force and blessed power.\\r\\nNow, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTITANIA.\\r\\nMy Oberon, what visions have I seen!\\r\\nMethought I was enamour’d of an ass.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nThere lies your love.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTITANIA.\\r\\nHow came these things to pass?\\r\\nO, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nSilence awhile.—Robin, take off this head.\\r\\nTitania, music call; and strike more dead\\r\\nThan common sleep, of all these five the sense.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTITANIA.\\r\\nMusic, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPUCK.\\r\\nNow when thou wak’st, with thine own fool’s eyes peep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nSound, music.\\n\\n [Still mucic.]\\n\\r\\nCome, my queen, take hands with me,\\r\\nAnd rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.\\r\\nNow thou and I are new in amity,\\r\\nAnd will tomorrow midnight solemnly\\r\\nDance in Duke Theseus’ house triumphantly,\\r\\nAnd bless it to all fair prosperity:\\r\\nThere shall the pairs of faithful lovers be\\r\\nWedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPUCK.\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Fairy king, attend and mark.\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0I do hear the morning lark.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOBERON.\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Then, my queen, in silence sad,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Trip we after night’s shade.\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0We the globe can compass soon,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Swifter than the wand’ring moon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTITANIA.\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Come, my lord, and in our flight,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Tell me how it came this night\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0That I sleeping here was found\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0With these mortals on the ground.\\n\\n [Exeunt.

Never did I hear\\r\\nSuch gallant chiding; for, besides the groves,\\r\\nThe skies, the fountains, every region near\\r\\nSeem’d all one mutual cry. I never heard\\r\\nSo musical a discord, such sweet thunder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,\\r\\nSo flew’d, so sanded; and their heads are hung\\r\\nWith ears that sweep away the morning dew;\\r\\nCrook-knee’d and dewlap’d like Thessalian bulls;\\r\\nSlow in pursuit, but match’d in mouth like bells,\\r\\nEach under each. A cry more tuneable\\r\\nWas never holla’d to, nor cheer’d with horn,\\r\\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.\\r\\nJudge when you hear.—But, soft, what nymphs are these?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEGEUS.\\r\\nMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep,\\r\\nAnd this Lysander; this Demetrius is;\\r\\nThis Helena, old Nedar’s Helena:\\r\\nI wonder of their being here together.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nNo doubt they rose up early to observe\\r\\nThe rite of May; and, hearing our intent,\\r\\nCame here in grace of our solemnity.\\r\\nBut speak, Egeus; is not this the day\\r\\nThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEGEUS.\\r\\nIt is, my lord.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\\n\\n Horns, and shout within.

Our intent\\r\\nWas to be gone from Athens, where we might be,\\r\\nWithout the peril of the Athenian law.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEGEUS.\\r\\nEnough, enough, my lord; you have enough.\\r\\nI beg the law, the law upon his head.\\r\\nThey would have stol’n away, they would, Demetrius,\\r\\nThereby to have defeated you and me:\\r\\nYou of your wife, and me of my consent,\\r\\nOf my consent that she should be your wife.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS.\\r\\nMy lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,\\r\\nOf this their purpose hither to this wood;\\r\\nAnd I in fury hither follow’d them,\\r\\nFair Helena in fancy following me.\\r\\nBut, my good lord, I wot not by what power,\\r\\n(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,\\r\\nMelted as the snow, seems to me now\\r\\nAs the remembrance of an idle gaud\\r\\nWhich in my childhood I did dote upon;\\r\\nAnd all the faith, the virtue of my heart,\\r\\nThe object and the pleasure of mine eye,\\r\\nIs only Helena. To her, my lord,\\r\\nWas I betroth’d ere I saw Hermia.\\r\\nBut like a sickness did I loathe this food.\\r\\nBut, as in health, come to my natural taste,\\r\\nNow I do wish it, love it, long for it,\\r\\nAnd will for evermore be true to it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nFair lovers, you are fortunately met.\\r\\nOf this discourse we more will hear anon.\\r\\nEgeus, I will overbear your will;\\r\\nFor in the temple, by and by with us,\\r\\nThese couples shall eternally be knit.\\r\\nAnd, for the morning now is something worn,\\r\\nOur purpos’d hunting shall be set aside.\\r\\nAway with us to Athens. Three and three,\\r\\nWe’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.\\r\\nCome, Hippolyta.\\r\\n\\n [Exeunt Theseus, Hippolyta,\\r\\nEgeus and Train.]\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS.\\r\\nThese things seem small and undistinguishable,\\r\\nLike far-off mountains turnèd into clouds.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nMethinks I see these things with parted eye,\\r\\nWhen everything seems double.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nSo methinks.\\r\\nAnd I have found Demetrius like a jewel,\\r\\nMine own, and not mine own.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS.\\r\\nAre you sure\\r\\nThat we are awake? It seems to me\\r\\nThat yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think\\r\\nThe Duke was here, and bid us follow him?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHERMIA.\\r\\nYea, and my father.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nAnd Hippolyta.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nAnd he did bid us follow to the temple.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS.\\r\\nWhy, then, we are awake: let’s follow him,\\r\\nAnd by the way let us recount our dreams.\\r\\n\\n [Exeunt.]\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\n[Waking.] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is\\r\\n‘Most fair Pyramus.’ Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the\\r\\nbellows-mender! Snout, the tinker! Starveling! God’s my life!\\r\\nStol’n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have\\r\\nhad a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if\\r\\nhe go about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can\\r\\ntell what. Methought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched\\r\\nfool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not\\r\\nheard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his\\r\\ntongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get\\r\\nPeter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be called\\r\\n‘Bottom’s Dream’, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing\\r\\nit in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it the\\r\\nmore gracious, I shall sing it at her death.\\r\\n\\n [Exit.]\\n\\nSCENE II. Athens. A Room in Quince’s\\r\\nHouse\\n Enter Quince, Flute, Snout and\\r\\nStarveling.\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nHave you sent to Bottom’s house? Is he come home yet?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSTARVELING.\\r\\nHe cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFLUTE.\\r\\nIf he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward, doth it?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nIt is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus\\r\\nbut he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFLUTE.\\r\\nNo, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nYea, and the best person too, and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.\\n\\n\\r\\nFLUTE.\\r\\nYou must say paragon. A paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught.\\r\\n\\n Enter Snug.\\n\\r\\nSNUG\\r\\nMasters, the Duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords\\r\\nand ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFLUTE.\\r\\nO sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life; he\\r\\ncould not have ’scaped sixpence a day. An the Duke had not given him\\r\\nsixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be hanged. He would have\\r\\ndeserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.\\r\\n\\n Enter Bottom.\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nWhere are these lads? Where are these hearts?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nBottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nMasters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if I tell you, I\\r\\nam not true Athenian. I will tell you everything, right as it fell out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nQUINCE.\\r\\nLet us hear, sweet Bottom.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM.\\r\\nNot a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the Duke hath dined. Get\\r\\nyour apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps;\\r\\nmeet presently at the palace; every man look o’er his part. For the short and\\r\\nthe long is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean linen;\\r\\nand let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for\\r\\nthe lion’s claws. And most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlick, for\\r\\nwe are to utter sweet breath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a\\r\\nsweet comedy. No more words. Away! Go, away!\\r\\n\\n [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT V\\nSCENE I. Athens. An Apartment in the Palace of Theseus\\n Enter Theseus, Hippolyta,\\r\\nPhilostrate, Lords and Attendants.\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA.\\r\\n’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nMore strange than true. I never may believe\\r\\nThese antique fables, nor these fairy toys.\\r\\nLovers and madmen have such seething brains,\\r\\nSuch shaping fantasies, that apprehend\\r\\nMore than cool reason ever comprehends.\\r\\nThe lunatic, the lover, and the poet\\r\\nAre of imagination all compact:\\r\\nOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold;\\r\\nThat is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,\\r\\nSees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt:\\r\\nThe poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\\r\\nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;\\r\\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\\r\\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen\\r\\nTurns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing\\r\\nA local habitation and a name.\\r\\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination,\\r\\nThat if it would but apprehend some joy,\\r\\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy.\\r\\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\\r\\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA.\\r\\nBut all the story of the night told over,\\r\\nAnd all their minds transfigur’d so together,\\r\\nMore witnesseth than fancy’s images,\\r\\nAnd grows to something of great constancy;\\r\\nBut, howsoever, strange and admirable.\\r\\n\\n Enter lovers: Lysander, Demetrius,\\r\\nHermia and Helena.\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nHere come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.\\r\\nJoy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love\\r\\nAccompany your hearts!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLYSANDER.\\r\\nMore than to us\\r\\nWait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nCome now; what masques, what dances shall we have,\\r\\nTo wear away this long age of three hours\\r\\nBetween our after-supper and bed-time?\\r\\nWhere is our usual manager of mirth?\\r\\nWhat revels are in hand? Is there no play\\r\\nTo ease the anguish of a torturing hour?\\r\\nCall Philostrate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE.\\r\\nHere, mighty Theseus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nSay, what abridgment have you for this evening?\\r\\nWhat masque? What music? How shall we beguile\\r\\nThe lazy time, if not with some delight?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE.\\r\\nThere is a brief how many sports are ripe.\\r\\nMake choice of which your Highness will see first.\\n\\n [Giving a paper.]\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\n[Reads] ‘The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung\\r\\nBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp.’\\r\\nWe’ll none of that. That have I told my love\\r\\nIn glory of my kinsman Hercules.\\r\\n‘The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,\\r\\nTearing the Thracian singer in their rage?’\\r\\nThat is an old device, and it was play’d\\r\\nWhen I from Thebes came last a conqueror.\\r\\n‘The thrice three Muses mourning for the death\\r\\nOf learning, late deceas’d in beggary.’\\r\\nThat is some satire, keen and critical,\\r\\nNot sorting with a nuptial ceremony.\\r\\n‘A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus\\r\\nAnd his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.’\\r\\nMerry and tragical? Tedious and brief?\\r\\nThat is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.\\r\\nHow shall we find the concord of this discord?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE.\\r\\nA play there is, my lord, some ten words long,\\r\\nWhich is as brief as I have known a play;\\r\\nBut by ten words, my lord, it is too long,\\r\\nWhich makes it tedious. For in all the play\\r\\nThere is not one word apt, one player fitted.\\r\\nAnd tragical, my noble lord, it is.\\r\\nFor Pyramus therein doth kill himself,\\r\\nWhich, when I saw rehears’d, I must confess,\\r\\nMade mine eyes water; but more merry tears\\r\\nThe passion of loud laughter never shed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nWhat are they that do play it?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE.\\r\\nHard-handed men that work in Athens here,\\r\\nWhich never labour’d in their minds till now;\\r\\nAnd now have toil’d their unbreath’d memories\\r\\nWith this same play against your nuptial.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nAnd we will hear it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE.\\r\\nNo, my noble lord,\\r\\nIt is not for you: I have heard it over,\\r\\nAnd it is nothing, nothing in the world;\\r\\nUnless you can find sport in their intents,\\r\\nExtremely stretch’d and conn’d with cruel pain\\r\\nTo do you service.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nI will hear that play;\\r\\nFor never anything can be amiss\\r\\nWhen simpleness and duty tender it.\\r\\nGo, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.\\n\\n [Exit Philostrate.]\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA.\\r\\nI love not to see wretchedness o’ercharged,\\r\\nAnd duty in his service perishing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nWhy, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHIPPOLYTA.\\r\\nHe says they can do nothing in this kind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nThe kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.\\r\\nOur sport shall be to take what they mistake:\\r\\nAnd what poor duty cannot do, noble respect\\r\\nTakes it in might, not merit.\\r\\nWhere I have come, great clerks have purposed\\r\\nTo greet me with premeditated welcomes;\\r\\nWhere I have seen them shiver and look pale,\\r\\nMake periods in the midst of sentences,\\r\\nThrottle their practis’d accent in their fears,\\r\\nAnd, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,\\r\\nNot paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,\\r\\nOut of this silence yet I pick’d a welcome;\\r\\nAnd in the modesty of fearful duty\\r\\nI read as much as from the rattling tongue\\r\\nOf saucy and audacious eloquence.\\r\\nLove, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity\\r\\nIn least speak most to my capacity.\\r\\n\\n Enter Philostrate.\\n\\r\\nPHILOSTRATE.\\r\\nSo please your grace, the Prologue is address’d.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nLet him approach.\\r\\n\\n Flourish of trumpets. Enter the\\r\\nPrologue.\\n\\r\\nPROLOGUE\\r\\nIf we offend, it is with our good will.\\r\\nThat you should think, we come not to offend,\\r\\nBut with good will.  To show our simple skill,\\r\\nThat is the true beginning of our end.\\r\\nConsider then, we come but in despite.\\r\\nWe do not come, as minding to content you,\\r\\nOur true intent is.  All for your delight\\r\\nWe are not here.

For all the rest,\\r\\nLet Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,\\r\\nAt large discourse while here they do remain.\\r\\n\\n [Exeunt Prologue, Pyramus, Thisbe,\\r\\nLion and Moonshine.]\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nI wonder if the lion be to speak.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS.\\r\\nNo wonder, my lord. One lion may, when many asses do.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWALL.\\r\\nIn this same interlude it doth befall\\r\\nThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall:\\r\\nAnd such a wall as I would have you think\\r\\nThat had in it a crannied hole or chink,\\r\\nThrough which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,\\r\\nDid whisper often very secretly.\\r\\nThis loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show\\r\\nThat I am that same wall; the truth is so:\\r\\nAnd this the cranny is, right and sinister,\\r\\nThrough which the fearful lovers are to whisper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nWould you desire lime and hair to speak better?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDEMETRIUS.\\r\\nIt is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTHESEUS.\\r\\nPyramus draws near the wall; silence.\\r\\n\\n Enter Pyramus.\\n\\r\\nPYRAMUS.\\r\\nO grim-look’d night!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
